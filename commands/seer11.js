  Don't...
 • ask how to pirate games
 • share full game data
 • mention piracy sites and tools by name
 • share game tickets and titlekeys
 • ask to share direct messages to help with piracy
 • discuss piracy in the assistance channels
 • in general commit copyright violations

What this means is:
- Don't ask about hshop, freeShop, USBHelper, NUSspli, or any sites/tools where games can be gotten from.
- Don't ask about ticket/titlekey sites or any key sites.
- Don't try and talk about them.
- Don't try and get around the filters or rules by saying you'll DM someone, or asking to be DMed.
