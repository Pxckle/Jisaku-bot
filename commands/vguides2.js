Other problems with video guides:
- Uploaders tend to care more about views than helping the community, so they don't remove old content
- This usually leads to confusion about which method is best, or most current
- Every uploader has a different route through each method, which often makes it very difficult to give assistance
- Pre-packaged downloads are often hosted on the uploader's server, which they use to generate clicks and revenue
- Pre-packaged downloads ("AIOs") are also very often outdated and not maintained by the creators
