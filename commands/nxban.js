  $title[1;Switch Bans]
  $description[1;
The Switch is a much more secure system than the 3DS, and Nintendo has upped their game when it comes to bans.
One of the main reasons for this is that there are significantly more monitoring systems, some of which cannot be turned off.

Remember that you can only reduce your chances of getting banned nothing is guaranteed, and you could be banned at any time if you decide to hack your device. It will always be a cat and mouse game, until or unless there are big changes in the scene.

Refer to ⁠faq-switch for a list of things to avoid doing to reduce your risks.
You cannot ask about unbanning your console here.
