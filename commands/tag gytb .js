**__How to install custom badges:__**

1. On the root of your SD card, make a folder called badges, and inside it put your custom badges, as .png files, with a size of 64x64, or a multiple of this, in which case the badge will get split up
2. Download and install GYTB https://github.com/MechanicalDragon0687/GYTB/releases (the .cia file)
3. Run the app, and all badges will be installed

**__Troubleshooting:__**
- Is there any file with dimensions that can't be divided by 64 in the badges folder? (check for and delete preview.png)
- Do you have over 1000 badges?
