  $sendMessage[Yes, one of the main reasons many, but not all end users modify their consoles is to pirate games.
However, the 'NintendoBrew Community' is not built around piracy, it is not built around enabling piracy, and the homebrew/CFW developers certainly do not do what they do with piracy in mind.
Enabling piracy is an unfortunate side effect.
Additionally, if we were to enable or encourage the discussion of piracy, we would be
a) breaking Discord TOS
b) breaking US law, which governs the use of Discord and
c) causing harm to the homebrew/CFW community and developers by de-legitimising the use case for homebrew/CFW.
So no, this server doesn't support piracy, doesn't seek to enable piracy and will not allow the discussion of using or finding pirated materials.]`
